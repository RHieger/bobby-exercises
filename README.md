# Exercises Focused on Array Methods

This repository is a clone of Landon Schropp&apos;s exercises focused on the three following methods exposed by the Array object:

- ```Array.prototype.map()```
- ```Array.prototype.filter()```
- ```Array.prototype.reduce()```

The exercises in this are comprised of unit tests using [Jestjs.io](https://jestjs.io) and contain my implementations of
solutions to the exercises.
